title: Simple Frames
---
My grandmother asked me to make a pair of frames for some paintings of hers.
While frames aren't particular fun (nor are they difficult), I could hardly
refuse.

I dislike big gaudy frames, and wanted to make something simple, strong. Since
they were for paintings, the recess had to be quite a bit deeper than normal to
accommodate the thickness of the canvas' frame.

I added splines to the corners to provide the real strength.
