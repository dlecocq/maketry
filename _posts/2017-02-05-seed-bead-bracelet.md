title: Seed Bead Bracelet
---
My daughter and I were at a gift shop at the Manitou Cliff Dwellings when she
saw some seed bead bracelets. She was really excited when I told her we could
make those kinds of things ourselves. I found this
[writeup](http://www.seedbeadsmarts.com/spiral-rope.html) on how to make
so-called spiral rope, and we started in on it a couple months later.

I had ordered an assortment of seed beads, all mixed together thinking that a
child wouldn't be so particular about the color of beads used. However, ever
the fastidious person, she was very particular so I found myself spending time
separating bead colors while she put them on the needle.

I was amazed that she had the patience to sit for up to an hour at a time adding
beads. That said, this project took maybe 5 or 6 hours at the pace she worked,
so it was a multi-week project. Perhaps seed beads are too fine for a small
child.

Still, we are both quite pleased with the result.

Before we revisit seed beads, I'll have to make a loom to expand the type of
project we can work on.
