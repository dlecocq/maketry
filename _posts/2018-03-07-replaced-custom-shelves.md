title: Replaced Custom Shelves
---
Erin's grandparents had a set of shelves that were made to resemble a spiral
staircase. It was in pretty rough shape - the top veneers were peeling and
warped.

My intention had been to use the original shelves as router template, but the
straight edges were not actually straight. So I decided to use their form to
construct new shelves with the table saw, forstner bit, bandsaw and router.

I had some scrap baltic birch, which worked just fine. A few coats of
polyurethane and it's ready for another lifetime of service.
