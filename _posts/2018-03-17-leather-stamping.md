title: Leather Stamping
---
My daughter came home after an outing with her aunt and showed me a little piece
of leather she had stamped. Apparently on the way home there was a booth where
kids could take a little square of leather and make their own design.

She was excited and surprised when I told her that we had all the stuff to do
that at home, too. We cut up a few scraps of leather into strips, wetted it, and
got to work creating some masterpieces:
