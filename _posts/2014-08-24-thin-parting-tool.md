title: Thin Parting Tool
---
Traditional parting tools are relatively wide (about 1/4"), but when parting off
pieces, this can be quite a lot of wood to waste.

Eddie Castelin [describes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRYPRMvrfzw) how to
make one using an old reciprocating saw blade.

After shaping the blade, I cut a slit in a piece of pine, covered the base of
the blade in polyurethane gorilla glue and set it in place in the handle. It's
not particularly pretty, but it is effective.
