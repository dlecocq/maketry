A while back I made my daughter a
[wooden hand plane]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-03-25-wooden-toy-tools %}).
To be honest, I was a little jealous of it, so I made one for myself.

I wanted this plane to be something that I'd use often, something that would
become a treasured tool in my shop. I had some free curly maple scraps that I'd
been holding on to for over a year, waiting for a project just like this one.
