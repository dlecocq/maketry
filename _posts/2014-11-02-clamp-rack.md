title: Clamp Rack
---
I treated myself to a set of clamps that happened to be on quite a sale. You
really can't have too many clamps, and with only four until now, I was in no
danger of that. But with a new set of 30, I needed to figure out where to put
them.

Turns out they fit very conveniently behind a door in my shop, so I made a quick
and simple rack for them. I drilled out evenly-spaced holes in a piece of
plywood, making sure that they were spaced about the width of the widest point
of the clamps. Then I took it to the table saw, cutting a slot from one edge to
the holes I'd drilled out.

This board got glued and screwed to a backer-board, and some triangular pieces
were glued and screwed to support the top part. After screwing the assembly to
the wall and letting the glue dry, it was ready to be loaded up!
