title: Patched Ceiling
---
When my roof leaked several months ago, it left a section of the ceiling was
left cracked and the skim coat crumbled off. With the roof now replaced, I set
about fixing it.

The last time I had this happen on some walls in this house, I was a little too
rushed and the end patch was not perfectly even with the rest of the wall. This
time I applied this patch in several layers, allowing each to dry and sanding
off any high spots. While the whole process then spanned several days, the
results are worth it, as it is impossible to tell that there was ever any
trouble with it.

I thinned down the last coat with water, per the the recommendation of the
all-purpose plaster compound I used. It went on smoother than the other coats.
