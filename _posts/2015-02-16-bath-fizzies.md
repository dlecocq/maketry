title: Bath Fizzies
---
While visiting my parents, Madeline and I made bath fizzies. The effervescence
is caused by the baking soda and citric acid reacting, but the reaction only
happens at any appreciable level once dissolved. In addition to the acid and
base, there's also epsom salt, some food coloring, some oils (essential and
olive).

If memory serves, we used
[this recipe](http://abeautifulmess.com/2015/03/homemade-bath-bombs.html), but
any recipe is a variation on the above theme. I find it difficult to add water
slowly enough to keep it from reacting while mixing. I've tried using a spray
bottle with the hope of distributing it relatively evenly from the beginning,
but I'm not sure how much that helps.
