title: Easter Basket
---
I really dislike wicker baskets -- storing them, using them, everything. But
given that Easter baskets are often treasured by children, I set about making
a collapsible one for Madeline.

I had originally hoped to get an Easter-themed reusable grocery bag (like the
ones that Chico makes). They're small and easily stored. I got a Halloween
themed one for Madeline for her trick-or-treat bag, but as far as I could tell,
they don't seem to make one for Easter.

Inspired to make one, I found a really great idea for a
[foldable fabric](http://www.instructables.com/id/Collapsible-Easter-Basket-for-Easy-Storage/?ALLSTEPS)
one and decided to make one out of leather.

I first cut out the pattern, giving each of the flaps a contour after
establishing the geometry.

With that in place, I was able to verify that the layout was roughly correct. To
make the button holds, I cut two holes on either end of a line I marked, then
connected the two with cuts.

Then came the sketching and burning in the design, taking care to clear all the
folds and flaps.

When dyeing this, I substantially diluted the dye with rubbing alcohol, and
wetted the leather considerably in hopes of getting a more even dye. I also
chose to use cloth rather than a dauber, and while it come out more even than
I'm used to, it was still not as even as I'd hoped.

Once dry, I could carefully paint in the details.

I applied neatsfoot oil to keep it soft and resolene to protect it. When sewing
on the button, I used a spacer to ensure that there would be room between the
button and leather to accommodate the flaps and the hand strap.
