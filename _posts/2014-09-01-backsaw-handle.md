title: Backsaw Handle
---
I bought this backsaw at a garage sale for a few dollars. It wasn't broken or
anything, but I had often fancied the idea of making a new saw handle.

I based it heavily on the profile from the original handle. This made me more
confident that the geometry would be right -- the angle of the handle, space for
the bolts. This one, however, was done without any power tools.

I cut the basic profile with a coping saw, refined it with a rasp. Once the
profile was perfect, I marked the same distance in from the edge around the
sides to serve as a guide for rounding them over with rasp and file. With the
edges perfectly rounded and shaped, came all the sanding to get rid of the
scratches.

So much sanding. The most effective tool here is abranet, as it's flexible and
was amenable to being pulled around all the curves.
