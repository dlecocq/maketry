title: Homemade Gummies

Not long ago I saw a video about making gummy treats at home from
[Grant Thompson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3_dV-e4d9c), and decided it
would be a fun project for the family.

We went the route of first making the mixture and then allowing it to cool so
that we could cut off the portion with bubbles and remelt it to ensure that we
get very clear castings. That part went perfectly, if messily.

One cooled, many of them were somewhat slimy. I tried using powdered sugar to
make them less so, but unfortunately that only made it messier. I've heard that
corn starch works better, so that's something I'll have to bear in mind if I try
it again.
