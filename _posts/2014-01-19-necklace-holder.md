title: Necklace Holder
---
Erin came to me one day with a request -- to help her make a rustic necklace
holder. I had some pallet wood, and picked a suitably rustic board, replete with
some cutoff nails and some bark inclusions.

We went and picked out some branches and twigs from the yard that would be used
to hold the necklaces themselves. We chose a few that we liked and figured out
where they should go, drilling appropriate holes to receive them. We cut the
bark at the base of each branch where it would be glued, sizing it to fit into
the drilled-out holes.

Before glueing, some light sanding and a little bit of finish and voila:
