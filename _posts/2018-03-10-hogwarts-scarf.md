title: Hogwarts Scarf

Following the instructions from
[Studio Knit](https://www.studioknitsf.com/how-to-knit-a-harry-potter-gryffindor-scarf-free-knitting-pattern/),
I knit a Harry-Potter-style scarf for my daughter for her birthday.

It's roughly 50" long, which seems to be a good size for a young child; for an
adult it would have to be longer. It took about 20 hours (I'm not particularly
fast at knitting), and just over two skeins of wool.

On the plus side, it afforded me plenty of time to catch up on movies.
