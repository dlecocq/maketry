title: Blackberry Jam
---
Himalayan blackberries are an invasive species in the pacific northwest, and
they've done quite well. What started out as a few shoots in my backyard two
years ago has become a monstrous bush that extends into four yards (mine and
three neighbors). While absolutely covered in thorns, it perennially provides
us with more blackberries than we can eat.

The bush, which lines my entire back fence, can provide as much as a quart per
day of blackberries at the height of the season. While we do eat some fresh, we
mostly make jam from it. Last year, it was enough for 60 8-oz jars of jam.

The first time I made jam was a couple of years ago and I was astounded at the
amount of sugar it takes to make jam. Lamenting this fact at work, a
mycologically-minded berry-picking coworker told me about
[Pamona's Pectin](http://www.pomonapectin.com/) which uses calcium as a catalyst
for setting up, rather than sugar. As a result, we can make jam with no added
refined sugar, though we do add apple juice concentrate for sweetening.
