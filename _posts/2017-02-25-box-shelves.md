title: Box Shelves
---
I wanted some shelves for the office to get some clutter that had been filling
up every horizontal surface. Many of these were keepsake items that for one
reason or another I couldn't get rid of, so making a dedicated space for them
was the next best thing.

I didn't want the supports to be visible, but most invisible shelf brackets
either are expensive or look not very sturdy. After a little bit of searching
I came across this design, which allows for hidden brackets while guaranteeing
stability. On the back of each box near the top, each side has a keyhole hanger
that slips over a screw drilled into the wall.

The boxes are mitered, given iron-on edge banding and then dyed black and
finished with wipe-on polyurethane. While I was batching these out from some
free-from-Craigslist plywood, I made a sixth for the bathroom.
