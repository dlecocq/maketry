Christmas of 2013, I gave Erin a music movement of her favorite carol, with the
promise that I would make a music box for her. This used a scroll saw pattern
from [Steve Good](http://scrollsawworkshop.blogspot.com/). I find scroll saw
work to be very stressful and slow-going, but with some patience I managed to
persevere.
