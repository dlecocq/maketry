title: Nest Necklace
---
Needing a gift for Mother's Day, I ran across a post about
[nest necklaces](http://www.sarahortega.com/2011/05/diy-bird-nest-necklace.html)
and thought it would be perfect. I ended up using a much finer gauge (32) and
making lots of loops.

For the first loops through all the beads, I made two passes before tying it off
and pulling it tight to group the beads together. I took care to make sure the
knot ended up inside one of the beads.

I continued wrapping around the beads until a satisfactory nest was built up. I
used a few short lengths of wire to temporarily hold the nest loops to the loops
that ran through the beads. With these secured, I could then work on a more
aesthetically pleasing wire wrap around each of these sections, making sure to
include the first loops through the beads.

To be honest, the whole process was a little frustrating and definitely fiddly.
If I were to do this again, it would be with a much heavier gauge. Still, I'm
pleased with the look of the piece.
