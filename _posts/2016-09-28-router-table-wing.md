title: Router Table Wing
---
My shop has lacked a router table for quite some time, and it's the sort of
thing that I know would get a lot of use. The problem is that it requires a lot
of real estate that I can't afford in my tiny shop.

Many people add a router table into their table saw wing and I've done just
that. I got some 1-1/2" angle iron, cut two V shapes into one side so that I
could fold the iron up to fit my table saw. I then carefully marked where I
needed holes to attach it to the table, and bolted it down making it as even
with the table as possible.

With that complete, I glued up two pieces of 5/8" baltic birch plywood to be the
table itself. To bring the total thickness to the right level, I glued a 2"
strip around the edges that would rest on the lip of the angle irons. I had to
remove some material from the sides to make clearance for the bolts attaching
the angle iron to the table.

The top was designed so to have a small lip that would rest on the top edge of
the angle irons. Then a recess to accept a plate (onto which a router can be
mounted) was routed out on the top.

Eventually I will be building a dedicated router lift from the plans from
[Matthias Wandel](https://woodgears.ca/router_lift/version1.html).
