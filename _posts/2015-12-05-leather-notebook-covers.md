title: Leather Notebook Covers
---
I recently took an introductory
[leatherworking class]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-11-22-introductory-leatherworking-class %})
and decided to make some leather gifts for family for the holidays. This is a
cover for [field notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/) for my mother-in-law who
is fond of owls.

I wish I could say that I drew this free-hand before burning it in, but I copied
it from a template. To do this, I printed out the template, covered it with
packing tape and really wetted the leather. Placing the template on the leather,
using a dull pencil, I traced out the picture, leaving an impression which can
then be followed with a soldering gun (with a tip that hasn't been used for
soldering).
