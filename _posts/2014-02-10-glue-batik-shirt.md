title: Glue Batik Shirt
---
Inspired by an article about using transparent Elmer's glue to some form of
batik, for Valentine's Day, I had Madeline help me make a shirt for Erin. It
featured some of Madeline's favorite phrases at the time, and a couple of hand
prints.

The batik resist process worked very well, but the Rit dye we used washed out
quite a bit once rinsed.
