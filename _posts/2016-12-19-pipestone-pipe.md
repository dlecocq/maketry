title: Pipestone Pipe
---
Several years ago I read about pipestone and its use in making ceremonial pipes.
The idea of being able to carve rock seemed really appealing, and so I ordered
a couple pounds of pipestone (also called catlinite) and set out to make a pipe
for a relative.

The stone is easily cut up with a hacksaw, so I was able to cut the block up
into manageable pieces. I drilled out the holes with normal drill bits, and then
set about shaping it with rasps, files, and sandpaper.

I didn't want anything particularly ornate -- just a simple, but pleasing shape.
Once finished, I put it in the oven and worked some paraffin into the surface to
give it a nice matte sheen.
