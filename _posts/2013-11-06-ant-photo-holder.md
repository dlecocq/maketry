title: Ant Photo Holder

David Reed Smith had a post about making these little
[wooden insects](http://www.davidreedsmith.com/articles/Ants/ants.htm) for
holding photos.

I thought it would be a fun project and would be good for craft fairs. In the
end, it proved to be very difficult and time-consuming. But they did look neat.

If I were to do this again, I would use thicker-gauge aluminum wire. The kind I
used was for mending fences and wasn't quite strong enough to be what I wanted.
It also helps to have a jig for making all the antennae identical!
