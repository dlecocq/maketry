title: Shoe Fix
---
Madeline has a pair of shoes that she loves that broke recently. She likes to
wear them with the strap pulled extremely tightly, which led to the failure. The
piece of fabric that held the metal ring for the velcro strap came off, but it
was simple enough to make a replacement out of leather.

Fortunately only one shoe failed. This meant that I could remove the same part
from both shoes -- one would be damaged, but the other could serve as a pattern
for duplication.

After cutting out two replacement pieces, I painted them both pink. I wasn't
able to mix an exact color match, but I got close enough that it's not readily
noticeable. I punched the holes in the leather for sewing, then used contact
cement to adhere the strap to the outside. Once secured, I ran a needle through
one of the punched holes to help with alignment when glueing the other side of
the flap to the inside, making sure to loop through the metal ring.

After it was all glued up, I used a speedy stitcher so that I could apply some
real force to puncture the fabric while sewing it up. I wasn't sure how best to
hide the knot -- I worried that leaving the knot on the inside would make it
uncomfortable to wear and cause the knot to unravel. Instead, I placed the big
ugly knot on the outside.
