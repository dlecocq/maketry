title: TV Cabinet

Not long ago I got a large batch of plywood for free off of Craigslist from a
local cabinetmaker. In it was a surprising amount of walnut-veneer plywood. With
it, I decided to make a TV stand.

All the components are dadoed into one another for strength. Square pieces of
scrap wood help to ensure that the glue-up remains square, and to ease clamping.

Once glued, I added iron-on edge banding to all the exposed edges. I cut out
some doors to be inset with hidden hinges. Several coats of shellac and some
light sanding in between coats, and I have a TV stand.

The dimensions were chosen specifically to house a rarely-used XBox, an set-top
box.
