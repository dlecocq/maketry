I've been working on updating my front yard. I figured my neighbors were sick of
looking at my crop of weeds, just as I was.

I began by pulling all the weeds that I could before laying down and stapling a
weed barrier in place. The trickiest part was cutting holes for all the existing
plants and working the pieces of weed barrier around them.

In some of the beds, I had to dig out some fill dirt so that it would be even
with the sidewalk and no longer spilling over. In one bed, the bulbs had grown
so prolifically that I had to dig out 20 or so at a time in one large clump
before spreading them out and separating them.

I ended up using way more mulch than I had originally estimated. Had I known how
much I would use, I would have bought from a supplier who could dump a couple
yards in my driveway instead of hauling it back from the big-box store bag by
bag. Still, I'm happy with the way it turned out.
