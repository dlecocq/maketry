title: Hard Candy
---
Every year, I like to make hard candies to send to friend and family in December.
I had some trouble getting the candy to turn out the way I wanted. Specifically,
it was chronically coming out sticky, and using citric acid seemed to make the
problem worse. So I began to document my batches in an attempt to figure out the
issue.

I begin with my notes, and the recipe updated based on my findings appears at
the end of this post.

# Notes
## 2017-10-01
Made lavender candy with hexagonal jewel molds from LorAnn's. In the single
recipe, I used about 1.25 droppers of flavoring, and it ended up being a bit too
subtle. With 3 drops of blue and 5 drops of red, we got an appropriate lavender
purple.

The webbing on the molds was a little thick. Reading suggests that each candy
should be separate and not be attached to any adjacent cavities.

## 2017-10-02
Made grapefruit candy with hexagonal jewel molds. Used approximately 9 droppers
of flavor and it's still not potent enough. With 10 drops of red and one of blue,
we got a grapefruit red, leaning slightly to purple. I added two teaspoons of
citric acid after the mixture had cooled to approximately 265º and it did not
burn. However, the citric acid had some clumps in it which were hard to remove
-- probably best to crush and/or sift in the future. The candy also came out a
little gummy, which may be a result of the oil or the acid.

We used a spatula to distribute the candy in the molds evenly. Filling 3/4 of
the mold cavities didn't quite leave enough room, so perhaps next time using
2/3 of the mold would be best. The technique worked well, otherwise, often
giving us completely detached candies.

## 2017-12-04
Made pomegranate candy with hexagonal jewel molds. At approximately 25 drops per
dropper, it takes about 3 droppers for one dram. I didn't use any citric acid in
this batch, and while it came out harder than the previous batch, it still
sticks to my teeth. I will try using less corn syrup in the next batch.

I used 7 droppers of flavoring, but I waited until all boiling had stopped after
removing from heat. That step is in the recipe from LorAnn's oils, but I hadn't
seen it before. This seemed to have a substantial impact on the intensity of the
flavor. I used 18 drops of red and 1 drop of blue dye, which produced a
relatively deep, dark red suitable for pomegranate or raspberry.

## 2017-12-05
Made grape candy, but tried using 3/4C of corn syrup after reading a couple of
articles suggesting that as an invert sugar it prevents the crystallization of
sugar and leads to more brittle, less gooey candy.

I used 12 drops red and 12 drops blue, which was a good ratio, but so dark as to
effectively be black.

I accidentally allowed the temperature to reach 310 degrees, and while the candy
has a slight burnt taste to it, it was the least sticky batch I've made to date.

## 2017-12-06
Mango candy with 14 drops yellow, 3 drops red; that provided a nice deep orange
appropriate for mango or orange flavors, but for peach I should ease off the red
so that it's not so dark.

I added 3/4C corn syrup like the last run, and allowed this batch to reach 305
degrees. After cooling to 265, I added about a teaspoon of citric acid after
removing all the clumps. It came out fine, but stickier than I would have liked.
I'll have to try tinkering with the recipe some more. Some sources also suggest
using cream of tartar.

## 2017-12-09
Lemon candy with no corn syrup, allowed this batch to reach 310 before cooling.
Added 3tsp of citric acid at 265 degrees. 10 drops of yellow made a color
appropriate for lemon.

The flavor was fine, but it was still a little sticky.

## 2017-12-09
Pear candy with no corn syrup and no citric acid. I have the suspicion that my
thermometer is not accurate, so I used an infrared thermometer as a second
opinion. The infrared thermometer was difficult to get a good reading with, but
was consistently about 10-15 degrees lower than the candy thermometer.

I allowed the batch to reach 318 degrees by my candy thermometer's scale before
turning off the heat. I stirred the mixture as well, until all the bubbling had
stopped. I have a suspicion that this helps to allow more water to leave the
mixture, without adding additional heat and therefore running the risk of
burning the sugar.

The candy was hard, but very grainy. I will try again with corn syrup, the
higher temperature, and stirring to release additional water.

## 2017-12-10
Pear (10 yellow, 2 green), licorice (15 blue, 15 red), cherry (10 red) candy
with 2/3 C corn syrup. Removed from heat after reaching 315 degrees, stirring to
allow all the bubbles to escape, and they came out as desired. Not gummy, not
grainy, not sticky. Success!

# Recipe
A holiday treat. I *highly* recommend reading through all the instructions and
notes before beginning, and be prepared that this may take a couple of
iterations to get right for your equipment and environmental conditions.

## Ingredients
- 2 C granulated sugar
- 2/3 - 3/4 C corn syrup
- 3/4 C water
- 0-3 tsp citric acid
- 2 drams (0.25 fl. oz.) flavor oils (typically LorAnn's)
- 1-2 tsp corn starch (optional)
- food coloring
- spray oil (like Pam)

## Tools
- candy thermometer
- molds, or baking sheet and aluminum foil
- spatula

## Instructions
1. Prepare molds. A very light dusting of spray oil is sufficient. If using
  molds, one coating will usually last 3-4 batches. If using a baking sheet,
  line the sheet with aluminum foil and lightly spray with cooking oil.
2. Mix the granulated sugar, water, corn syrup in a pot on medium heat. Insert
  candy thermometer so that it does not touch the bottom, is suspended in the
  mixture.
3. Mix occasionally until boiling clear. Until the water is hot enough, not all
  the sugar will dissolve. An occasional stir until then helps in staving off
  minor burning on the bottom, but it's not terribly necessary. At some point,
  the mixture will pick up in bubbling as a white opaque suspension, and then
  suddenly turn clear as it continues to bubble. No stirring is necessary at
  this point.
4. Around 250-270° F, add food coloring. See below for some color suggestions.
5. Promptly remove from heat at 300-310° F (hard crack). Your candy thermometer
  may or may not be calibrated at this temperature, so the reading on your
  thermometer may vary. The temperature will rise slightly after removed from
  heat, but don't worry about that.
6. Stir the mixture while it is still at hard crack temperature. The goal is to
  allow additional water to escape; bubbling will increase. Stop stirring when
  only tiny bubbles remain, and allow them to dissipate.
7. Add flavorings and mix thoroughly. Approximately two drams (0.25 fl. oz.)
  gives a nice, strong flavor. If using a dropper, this is about 150 drops, or
  about 6-7 droppers full.
8. If using citric acid, allow the mixture to cool to 265-270° F before mixing
  it in. Adding it while the mixture is too hot produces an unpleasant bitter
  flavor in the candies.
9. Remove the thermometer from the mix. Setting it in a glass of water allows
  the hardening candy on it to dissolve.
10. Pour the candy into the molds, using the spatula to scrape the bottom and
  sides of the pot as you go. The candy cools quickly when in thin sheets, so
  keeping the molten candy all together in the pot as you pour provides the
  highest yield.
11. Use the spatula to quickly smooth out the candy. It hardens quickly, so do
  not overwork it.
12. If using a baking sheet as a mold, once the candy has cooled a bit, you may
  want to use a butter knife to score the sheet of hardening candy so that it's
  easier to break apart. The candy must be soft enough to allow you to push in
  the knife, but hard enough that it doesn't stick to the knife or re-melt
  together.
13. Once cooled, break them apart and store them. Coating a batch in a teaspoon
  or two of corn starch will prevent candies from sticking together if the batch
  is slightly tacky.

## Color Suggestions
- lavender - 3 drops blue, 5 drops red
- grapefruit - 10 drops red, 1 drop blue
- pomegranate, raspberry - 18 drops red, 1 drop blue
- grape - 8 drops red, 8 drops blue
- mango, orange - 14 drops yellow, 3 drops red
- lemon - 10 drops yellow
- pear - 10 drops yellow, 2 drops green
- licorice - 15 drops blue, 15 drops red
- cherry - 10 drops red

## Problem Solving

### Sticky Candy
This is usually because there is too much moisture in the candy. Your
thermometer may not be calibrated correctly, so try allowing the mixture to get
maybe 5° F hotter the next time. As the mixture approaches the right
temperature, it may start to smell very slightly of caramelization, which is one
indication I use. You can also take some of the mixture and drop it into cold
water. It should instantly become hard and brittle and not tacky when you bite
it.

### Bitter Candy
If you're using citric acid, adding it in while the mixture is too hot can cause
a very unpleasant bitter taste. Allow the mixture to cool to about 265°F before
missing in the citric acid.

### Grainy Candy
If the candy comes out opaque and grainy, you are probably not using enough corn
syrup. [Read more](https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/10/28/sugar-chemistry-of-hard-candies/)
about why it's used. I've also had some success using a few teaspoons of citric
acid in place of corn syrup, and others claim to use cream of tartar for the
same purpose.
