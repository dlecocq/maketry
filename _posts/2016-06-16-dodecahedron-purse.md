title: Dodecahedron Purse
---
In college I become briefly enamored of platonic solids. I don't remember what
the impetus was, but I got it in my head that I could make a dodecahedron purse
for my daughter.

The leather was stiff enough that it was very difficult to get everything glued
together and sewn. It relaxed a bit after being oiled, but unless I made a
bigger one, it's more a novelty than anything else.
