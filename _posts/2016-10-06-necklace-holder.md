title: Necklace Holder

My daughter loves necklaces. Not nearly as much as she likes keeping them
organized. I had her work with me to pick out some drawer pulls she liked, and
then she helped me in the workshop to lay out the holes and the angles. A little
sanding, a little paint, and we had a necklace holder.
