For Valentine's day, I made some heart pendants and earrings with walnut and
epoxy. While I still find scroll saw work to be stressful and slow-going, these
turned out alright. While it's not immediately apparent, I'm pleased that I was
able to get the grain to match across all the nested hearts on the pendant.
