title: Painted Frame
---
My mother requested a more ornate frame than I'm used to making. Specifically,
she wanted it to have something other than a flat profile, and she wanted it
painted gold for a quilted piece that a friend made for her. The profile was
cut with the router, and I used gold acrylic paint. While for the most part the
brush strokes aren't apparent, they are certainly visible if you look for them.
I'm not sure if that adds to the aesthetic appeal or whether it would have been
better to use a gold spray paint.
