title: Segmenting Sled

I made a table saw sled for making segmented rings for woodturning, based
heavily off of Stephen Ogle's [design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCFgyYYjJeg).
I've got an upcoming project the requires some segmenting and I've been meaning
to do this for some time now.

__Update 2017-04-22__: While this does work very effectively, I may in the
future try a different style, called a
[wedgie sled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdF7sKMKRR0). It is simpler to
build and more-easily adjusted.
