A while back I experimented with some
[batik with glue]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-02-10-glue-batik-shirt %})
on a shirt as a gift, but after watching some videos feature real batik, I
became mesmerized.

I got some batik wax which I mixed with paraffin, some tjantings for applying
the wax and set aside a morning to try. Using my double boiler from candlemaking
I wasn't able to get the wax hot enough to really soak in a well as I needed to.
Even so, I was able to get _some_ masking to work.

The idea has been that after I did the part with the blisteringly hot wax, I
could let my daughter play with fabric dye as if it were paint. If it went well,
eventually we could even make her some shirts or dresses. I think I just need to
get a wax melting pot specifically made for batik.
