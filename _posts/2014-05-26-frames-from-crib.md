title: Frames from Crib
---
As my daughter grew big enough to require a bed, the question came up of what to
do with her old crib. Erin couldn't stand the thought of getting rid of it, and
I disliked the idea of having to store a large object that wouldn't be used
for the foreseeable future.

I came up with what I thought was an elegant compromise and made frames with the
wood from the crib.

Some of the slats, I ripped in half lengthwise. When glued to full-width slats,
that would give the effect of having a rabbet cut. I did this because it was
important to me to leave the finish on most of the boards so that it would still
be immediately recognizable as her old crib. (When gluing finished surfaces
together, it's important to scrape off any finish of the surfaces that will
have glue in order to ensure proper adhesion.)

While most of the frames were done in this fashion, I discovered an interesting
pattern while cutting the crib up. Where the slats entered the top and bottom,
the cut-off portion of the slats stayed in the rails, giving the effect of a
periodic rounded slat shape. I cut up one frame from these, doubling up the
rails. I even cut the frame up in such a way that I could reuse the knock-down
bolts from the crib to assemble the frame.
