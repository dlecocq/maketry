title: Wooden Sword (Orcrist)
---
My sister is quite the Lord of the Rings fan, so for her birthday this year I
made her a wooden copy of the sword Orcrist. Well, technically it's scaled down
about 20% to make it more reasonable for her height.

The idea was not my own -- it was [Paul Jenkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJBlvem4CY)
who did it first.

I shaped the blade and tang from a piece of anonymous hardwood, using planes and
spokeshaves to get the bevels just right. The other embellishments were made
from sandwiched pieces of walnut. It took a lot of delicate cutting, shaping to
make sure that all the pieces matched up the way they were supposed to.
