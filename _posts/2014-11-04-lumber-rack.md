title: Lumber Rack
---
A while back, I made a rolling lumber rack, but it turned out to be bulky,
unwieldy, space-inefficient, and quickly lent itself to disorganization. I made
one instead out of 2x4's screwed to the walls, with 1-1/2" conduit left over
from a failed project to build homemade clamps.

I'd recently made a pantorouter as designed by
[Matthias Wandel](https://woodgears.ca/pantorouter/) and with it was able to
make holes _exactly_ sized to the conduits at a slight upward angle. The tight
holes meant the conduits required a little bit of 'convincing' to get them set,
but once in, they weren't going to move.

I'd been a little concerned about the strength of the conduits, but each length
(about 18" long), could hold my weight when the board was clamped to my bench.
That made me confident that three conduits would easily hold boards that weigh
less than I do.

The design was very space-efficient, inexpensive, and provides as much storage
as a shop my size could need.
