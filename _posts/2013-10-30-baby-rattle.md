title: Baby Rattle
---
I had previously made a
[rattle]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-08-03-inlace-baby-rattle %}) for my
cousin's baby, and wanted to make one for my own 18-month-old. This was
constructed in a somewhat similar fashion.

The main difference was that the handle was made from a separate piece and had
a tenon fit into a mortise in the head. This also provided the opportunity to
only add the beads once the head had been completely finished, and as the handle
was being glued in.

The piece overall was meant to be reminiscent of a pawn in chess.
