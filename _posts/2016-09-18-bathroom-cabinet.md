title: Bathroom Cabinet
---
One of my bathrooms has a mirrored medicine cabinet over the sink that's made
of particle board and seems on the verge of falling apart. I made this bathroom
cabinet to replace its use (though not over the sink).

The carcass is made from free douglas-fir-veneered plywood that I got from a
local cabinet maker. The sides, top and bottom are mitered together, and the
center two shelves are dadoed into the sides. Once glued up, I was able to apply
some thin strips as edge-banding.

The door is made from an anonymous hardwood rails and stiles. The center panel
is a piece of 3/16" plywood that I got from the same cabinetmaker.

After everything was sanded, glued, I stained the whole thing black and finished
it with several coats of polyurethane. I used four L-brackets on the middle two
shelves to attach it securely to two studs.
