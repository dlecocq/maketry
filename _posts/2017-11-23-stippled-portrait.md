title: Stippled Portrait
---
My mother has a portrait of her grandfather done in stipple. It's a really
beautiful style, and one I had never experimented with, so for a present for
my mother, I thought she'd enjoy a portrait of her father in the same fashion.

I used watercolor paper as I liked the texture and it's what I had on hand. I
thought about using the smoother back side of the paper, but I feared it might
look weird. I used a Pigma Micron 02 pen, which is supposed to not fade with
time.

I found it not all that different from pencil, in that it was easy to get the
hand of shading, even if it did take more time and thought. What I did not
expect was how long the dark areas take to fill in. The jacket alone in this
picture took about 8 hours.

The aspect I found most difficult was the hair. I wanted to do this picture in
a bit of a vacuum without taking cues from other examples of similar portraits.
This is the only area where I'm not entirely happy with what I ended up with,
but I suppose it plays reasonably well.
