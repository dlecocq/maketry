title: Monthly Painting - Octopus
---
This month my daughter wanted to paint, so I took that as an opportunity to do
my own monthly painting. She was painting a page with an octopus and other sea
creatures, so I thought I'd try my own. I tried to use one purple as the main
color, with a darker purple as an accent on the edge to try to give it some
depth (around the edges, the tops of the tentacles, around the eyes).

I also reserved another purple for the underside of the tentacles to really sell
the fact that the tentacles are twisted around this way and that. I tried to add
a little gray around the edges of the eyes, but in the end it washed out.

One thing I dislike about this one is that there's a very obvious seam where the
tentacles meet the body. I'm not sure how to better blend those transitions, but
perhaps practice will help.
