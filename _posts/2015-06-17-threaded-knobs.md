I never seem to have enough threaded knobs for shop fixtures and jigs, so I
made a new batch. I like this method because they're perfectly centered and
balanced. They're also a great way to use up some scraps.

While this can be used to make loose knobs, it's best to epoxy in the threaded
rod with this style.
