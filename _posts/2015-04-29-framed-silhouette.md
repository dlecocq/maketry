I made a trio of framed silhouettes of my daguther for Mother's Day for Erin, my
mother, and my mother-in-law. For those intimidated by making the silhouette,
you can buy custom silhouettes from folks on Etsy.

For cutting out the silhouette, my initial plan had been to take a picture of my
daughter, edit it on my computer to get the silhouette and cut it out to make
trace the silhouette onto some matte cardstock. In the end, that proved
difficult, time-consuming, and I wasn't thrilled with the results. Instead, I
printed out the picture I planned to use, and traced out a profile that was
based on the picture, but also had some interpretive variations.
