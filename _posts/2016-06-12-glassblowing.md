title: Glassblowing

Inspired by a groupon, some coworkers from my craft circle and I went to a
glassblowing class. We got to do a little bit of it, like adding the color,
rolling it around in the colored frit, and such. But it was not as hands-on as
we'd originally hoped. Still, we had fun, and I would like to learn more.
