After a break-in, Erin's jewelry box was stolen. While I couldn't replace it
exactly, I could at least make her a new one. I made a series of six, each with
different veneers for the lids, for several members of the family so that each
would have something that's more or less the same, but still with a unique look.

All the wood is either reclaimed, offcuts, scraps or from garage sales. The
veneers come from a huge box I got at a garage sale. The sides and lid frame
were made from scrap hardwood I got for free off of Craigslist. The inset lip is
made from floorboards from the original Ballard post office, also found on
Craigslist.

At some point, I'll be making a drop-in tray to sit on the inset lip.
