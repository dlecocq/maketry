title: Moon Tree
---
I first heard about
[Moon Trees](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/moon_tree.html) thanks
to [Destin and Sixty Symbols](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qGbkFhxYhs). They
are trees grown from seeds that were taken to the moon on Apollo 14. While
driving down to Oregon for the 2017 eclipse, we drove through Olympia and Salem,
home to collectively four moon trees.

Two of them are on private property, but we were able to see the other two. From
each we grabbed a couple of pinecones that had fallen to the ground with the
hopes of germinating some seeds and growing our own second-generation moon
trees.

It was only when we got back to Seattle that we realized that one of the cones
must have been from another tree, because it was not the type of cone associated
with the Salem tree. Both trees are Douglas Firs, but one of the cones is not
from a Douglas Fir.

We tried germinating them following an amalgam of several protocols described
by [several](http://sites.psu.edu/plantpropagationsbysean/2014/11/23/how-to-grow-a-douglas-fir-from-seed/)
[different](http://homeguides.sfgate.com/germinate-douglas-fir-seeds-39637.html)
sources, but unfortunately none of the seeds was viable.
