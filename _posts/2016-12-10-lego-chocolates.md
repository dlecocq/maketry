title: Lego Chocolates
---
I found myself wondering how chocolate was made, and on a lark set out to make
chocolate at home. I followed
[these directions](http://www.precisionnutrition.com/chocolate-making), though
it didn't turn out exactly as I'd hoped. It's possible that I didn't mix it
well enough, but I found that the honey tended to sink to the bottom, leaving
a very inconsistent texture.

We tried again the next week, this time using sugar and mixing more thoroughly.
These were much better -- very hard, but a pleasing texture as they melted in
our mouths. We poured the mixture into the lego molds we used for
[homemade gummies]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-09-10-homemade-gummies %}).
