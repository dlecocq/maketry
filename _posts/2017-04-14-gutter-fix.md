title: Gutter Fix
---
It's happened a couple of times now that my gutters have detached from my house.
Apparently they were put in with gutter spikes, a method that I now have no
faith in.

As in the last case, I replaced them with screw-in gutter brackets that seem far
sturdier. The only difficult thing with this instance was that the fence was
close enough to the house that it made it a little precarious to get up to full
height on the ladder.
