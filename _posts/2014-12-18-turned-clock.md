I turned a clock as a gift; it's made of two layers of some anonymous hardwoods
from the scrap bin, with the indicators out of padauk.

__Update 2017-04-22__: I turned this in humid Seattle, and gave it to someone
living in arid Colorado and it has experienced a fair bit of movement. I should
have used more (thinner) layers.
