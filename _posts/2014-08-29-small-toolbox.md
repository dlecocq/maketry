title: Small Toolbox
---
I found myself nostalgic for the toolbox that I grew up with and wanted to make
one for my daughter. She's just a couple of years, so rather than a proper
toolbox, I thought a smaller one would be in order.

I decided to make one with dovetails (my first dovetails, hand-cut), and the
handle fits in to a stop-dado in either side.
