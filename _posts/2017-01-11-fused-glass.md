title: Fused Glass
---
I don't remember how or where I found about them, but there are these really
cool kilns that make it possible to do fused glass projects _in the microwave_.
My daughter loves bracelets and necklaces, and I thought this would be a neat
way to get her engaged with making things.

With the kit we got, she was able to help me stack a few pieces of glass to make
a design, at which point I can deal with all the dangerous stuff involving the
molten glass. In reality, it wasn't particularly dangerous -- using an infrared
thermometer, I found that even when the glass was so hot as to incandesce, the
outside of the kiln was only about 150 degrees Fahrenheit.

For most fused glass projects, we allow them to cool for a full hour to
normalize well and hopefully not have too much stress in the finished product.
We've not experimented yet with tempering cycles. For our first project,
however, we couldn't resist taking off the lid briefly to get a picture of the
glowing-hot glass.

After about an hour, the glass pieces are about 400 degrees Fahrenheit still,
but at that point we let them cool in the open air. At this temperature, they're
no longer glowing, and we first get a glimpse of what the project will look
like.

The 'paper' used in the kiln has a slight texture to it, which is embossed on
the glass. We found that the hotter the glass is allowed to get, the worse this
effect is (it makes sense -- as it gets hotter it should become less viscous and
thus seep more). Regardless, we need to use diamond files to smooth out the back
as well as give a bevel to the bottom edge. While it's not the most beautiful
fused glass, it's been very neat to be able to make it at home.
