title: Workbench Drawers
---
Not long after building my
[workbench]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-01-14-workbench %}), I realized
how useful it would be to have drawers in it. Not only that, but when planing
boards, it had a tendency to jump around quite bit, and I wanted to add some
weight to it.

I bought some playground sand from a local hardware store, added a plywood
bottom to the bench and filled up some job site garbage bags full of sand to
rest on the recently-added bottom. I closed it in with another piece of plywood
that would serve as the base for the cabinet carcass.

I added sides, a center divider, a back, and a top. The bench was not designed
with this application in mind, so it took a little creative thinking to get it
figured out. I bought 100-pound full-extension drawer slides, since I figured
these would take quite a bit of abuse over the years. With them in hand, I could
use their thickness to figure out just how wide my drawers had to be.

The drawers are simple in construction. They use
[lock-rabbet drawer joints](http://www.woodmagazine.com/woodworking-tips/techniques/joinery/lock-rabbet-drawer-joints)
for strength, and the bottom is similarly locked in.

The drawer slides on the sides are screwed in, but since the center ones compete
for real estate with each other, I just put bolts through one, the center
divider, and then the other.

With the drawers in place, I could cut up the single panel for the front, and
and then all of the drawer fronts out of it. This made it so that the grain
matches across the whole front.

The handles are just cut from pine 2x4's, first cutting a rabbet out of one
corner, then a miter to give the top a nice slope, and then two more miters to
taper the handle from back to front.
