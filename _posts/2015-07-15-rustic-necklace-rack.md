I wanted to make a necklace rack for my sister, and I thought I would give it a
shot using as few power tools as possible. I had some firewood that seemed
perfect for the project (after making sure to get rid of all the
creepy-crawlies).

While this project turned out _ok_, I prefer the one I'd done
[previously]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-01-19-necklace-holder %}).
