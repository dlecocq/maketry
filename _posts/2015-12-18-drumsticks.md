title: Drumsticks
---
After a craft fair at work, a coworker approached me about making two pairs of
drumsticks to present to her husband and a friend in recognition of some
drum-education-based charity work they'd done. I agreed, and as they'd be
ornamental, I made them as a lamination with three veneers running through
middle, though I did make them in a standard size.

The most difficult part of this project was the fact that because they were so
long and thin, there was a great deal of vibration and flexing.
