title: Wood and Resin Ring
---
Not long ago, Peter Brown had a video about making
[his own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poNzkmOAL4k) wood and resin rings
inspired by [Secret Wood Rings](https://mysecretwood.com/). I knew my sister
would love one, so I set out to make her such a ring for Christmas.

I took some 1/4" maple, clamped it down to my bench with a portion overhanging
the edge, and broke off pieces with a mallet. It took a few tries, but
eventually I got a few good breaks that would work well.

I didn't have any resin dye, but I figured I'd try powdered wood dye. While it
didn't give the most consistent coloring, it worked out in the end. I taped up
around the blanks to make a sort of cup out of masking tape and poured the resin
in. After curing, I flattened each blank, drilled a hole out to make the 'ring'
part, and cut a rough profile out on the bandsaw.

This project involved a lot of sanding and shaping. For the resin part, I
thought it would be best to try to give it a gem feel with lots of flat
surfaces intersecting at interesting angles, rather than something with softer
edges.

While this picture is without finish, adding a little spray lacquer really made
everything pop.
