I needed to make gifts for a couple of friends, and I'd recently seen The Wood
Knight make a [celtic knot pen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifLP5SJDEoc) so
I thought I'd give it a shot.

The inserts are made from layered veneers to give a bit more visual interest.
One set of inserts has the light wood on the outside (to be inserted into the
dark wood) and the other set has the dark wood on the outside (to be inserted
into the light wood).
