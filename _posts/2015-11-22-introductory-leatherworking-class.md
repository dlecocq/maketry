title: Introductory Leatherworking Class
---
I took my daughter to the Seattle Mini Maker Faire, where we saw a booth by a
local leatheworker. We got to talking and she offers classes. I told her that
sometimes makers from my work get together to learn new schools and one thing
led to another and some coworkers and I went and took a class from her.

I'd been looking to get into leatherworking, but there's a bit of a cost to
entry and there's always the uncertainty about whether it's something that one
will actually continue to be interested in. While the instructor's style was
more rustic and less precise than is my preference, it was very helpful in
giving me some context about how to work with leather, what was attainable, and
whether I'd continue to be interested in it.

In particular:

- __sewing__ - we were instructed to make holes for sewing _before_ connecting
  two pieces of leather; this led to the holes not lining up perfectly
- __glueing__ - the sides were sewn together rather than glued and _then_ sewed
- __sizing__ - all the pieces for a project were cut from templates and then
  assembled, rather than glued, trimmed, and then sewed; that approach ensures
  that two or more joined pieces' edges line up perfectly.

All this said, I really like her work, and her style. I just mean that it's not
_my_ style. The week after taking the class, I went and bought supplies. I was
clearly hooked.

This is the moleskine cover that I made in the class, for my sister-in-law.
