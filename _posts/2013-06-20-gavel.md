title: Gavel

With Erin working hard in law school, I thought it would be appropriate to make
a gavel for her. This was in no small part inspired by a
[now-unavailable YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76I_9y64Tls)

At the time, I didn't have very many blanks particularly long enough, so the
handle ended up being very stubby. Another difficult point was the interface
between the handle and the head -- both are turned objects, and so a taper on
the handle to go into the head is most appropriate.
