title: Knit Socks

One of the members of my craft circle is quite fond of fiber arts. Several of us
had done some amount of knitting, but had never knit socks, so she offered to
teach us.

I'd knit in the round before using double-ended needles, which were a tremendous
pain. Using circular needles made the experience far nicer.

It took me about 10 hours per sock, so it's far from particularly practical.
Still, they came out nice and seemed to fit well.
