title: Office Shelves
---
Until now, we'd just been using a baker's rack as some makeshift storage in the
office / storage room in our house. But it didn't provide a whole lot of storage
despite its bulk, and things would regularly fall off as it didn't have a back
or sides.

I made some built-in shelves out of 2x2" uprights and tapered 2x4" arms
mortise-and-tenoned in place, thanks to the pantorouter I built. I knew they'd
be strong, but I wasn't sure just _how_ strong. Each arm was capable of
supporting my weight (230lbs).

Screwed to the studs, I attached some 5/8" baltic birch plywood shelves. I added
an upright on the end of each shelf. A dado in the side receives the glued-in
shelf.

This has been a really helpful development, as it provides a huge amount of
storage. It's finished in a few coats of shellac.
