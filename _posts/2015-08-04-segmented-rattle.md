title: Segmented Rattle

A coworker recently had a little baby girl, and so I made a rattle for her.
Because it has to be hollowed out I knew I would at least be gluing up two
halves, so I figured I'd go all-out and make the head of the rattle completely
segmented. It's made of walnut and reclaimed oak floorboards.

I'd never turned a sphere, but I followed the directions provided by
[Alan Stratton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6xG-i5e4Pk) and it worked out
just fine.
