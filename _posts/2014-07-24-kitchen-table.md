title: Kitchen Table
---
My sister moved close by not long ago after she graduated from college. While
she had some furniture, she lacked a small kitchen-/dining-table.

I imagined that like many people her age, she'd move around a few times in the
coming years, and so this table was designed to be readily disassembled. The
legs connect to the apron with cross-dowels / knock-down bolts, and the apron
connects to the top with screws. Ideally the top would be more free to expand,
but so far there haven't been any problems (fingers crossed).

All the aprons are numbered with the leg they attach to so that it's clear how
to reassmble it.
