title: Egg Holder Redux
---
Since my previous attempt at an
[egg holder]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-05-12-egg-holder %}) didn't pan
out as I'd hoped, I chose to attack this again.

This was for my dad, and he had once told me about an old favorite tool of his,
a rolling pin (he was a baker for many years) made out of teak. As a small
reference to that, I decided to make it out of some teak I'd gotten from an old
outdoor chair that I got for free on Craigslist.

After cutting up the segments, and glueing them together in rings, I flattened
each ring and glued them together taking care to keep the centers aligned and
the joints offset from layer to layer. Once dry, I glued it to a waste block for
turning on the lathe.

I cupped out the interior first, ensuring that an egg fit in securely. It should
be approximately the shape of an egg bottom, but the egg should rest on the lip,
and not on the bottom. This provides the best support. Once the top is cupped
out, the full profile can be carved.
