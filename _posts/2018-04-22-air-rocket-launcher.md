title: Air Rocket Launcher
---
We attended the Albuquerque Maker Faire, and the coolest activity we did was to
make and launch paper rockets. Turns out the launcher is pretty straightforward -
it's a PVC reservoir and is controlled with a sprinkler solenoid. The more
detailed instructions are in [the book](https://smile.amazon.com/Make-Rockets-Down-Earth-Science/dp/1457182920/).

It uses a schrader valve, so it can be easily pumped up with a bike pump. While
I don't know really how high the rockets go, they do go surprisingly high and
launch with a satisfying "thunk" sound.
