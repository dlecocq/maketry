My craft circle and I made soap. I'd done so before in college, but it never
came out particularly well, so I was pleased to try again.

For my mold, I liked the idea of having circular soaps and so I used a section
of PVC. For some reason, I thought that the cured soap wouldn't stick to the
sides, but I was wrong.

In the end, I had to cut the pipe lengthwise on the table saw to get it open.
Lesson learned. Some people cast theirs in the wax-paper-lined wooden molds that
I made. Those people were happier:

After a couple of days, I sliced them open and allowed them to dry.

Eventually my circular ones came out just fine.
