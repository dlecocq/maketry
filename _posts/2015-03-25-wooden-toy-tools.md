I made a set of woodworking tools for my daughter, including a hand plane, saw,
mallet, square and screwdriver to go with the
[toolbox]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-08-29-small-toolbox %}) and her own
workbench. While the mallet and square are perfectly functional, the saw and
screwdriver are not.

The handplane accepts the same size iron that my block plane does, and while it
currently has a wooden 'blade,' it would be functional if she ever decided to
use it with a real iron.
