title: Watercolor Portrait
---
I really dislike working with watercolors, but not long ago I found out about
watercolor pencils. I'm fond of colored pencils, and with the advent of brushes
that hold their own water, I decided to try my hand at it to make a portrait of
my daughter as a gift to my mother. After finishing it, of course I made the
corresponding frame.

It was challenging, and I could benefit from a lot of practice, but I've come
to really like the medium.
