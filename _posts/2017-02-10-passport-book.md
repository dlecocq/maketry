title: Passport Book
---
I applied to renew my passport recently, and in anticipation I decided to make
a leather book to hold all relevant documents when traveling. It's not unlike a
moleskine cover, with two pockets, each designed to hold a passport, and a snap
clasp to close it all up.

I burned in a map of the world just to keep with the theme.
