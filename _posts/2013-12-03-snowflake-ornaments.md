title: Snowflake Ornaments
---
Inspired by a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW5r4gVrtZQ) from
Woodworking for Mere Mortals, I decided to make a batch or two of snowflake
ornaments.

I'd recently become interested in taking part in craft fairs, and given that
the holiday season was fast approaching, I thought this would be a good way to
round out my stock.

I more or less followed WWMM's process very carefully. However after slicing up
all the snowflakes from the snowflake extrusion, I used my disk sander to sand
them all rather than a palm sander. While it did make it go much faster, it
still took a long time and I lost a couple of fingertips in the process.

All in all I made about 150 in various different shapes. I finished these with
water-based polyurethane with a brush, but I would certainly recommend using a
spray in the future.
