title: Snack Bowl
---
Much of my turning inspiration is because of Carl Jacobson's videos on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/haydenHD). On his channel, he turns
(among other things) bowls.

I had made a few attempts at turning bowls. I began by turning green wood, a
decision driven in by the facts that 1) the materials were essentially free,
2) I lacked tools to make segmented bowls, and 3) I liked the idea of using
local lumber.

I don't remember the details of how I made this particular bowl. I _believe_ I
turned it while green, first turning the outside and a tenon. I then reversed
it, turned the inside, sanded the whole thing.

At the time, I often got rid of the tenon in a really dangerous (and
ineffective) way -- I'd hold the bowl firmly in one hand and try to chisel it
off with the other. Writing about it now, nearly four years after, it still
makes me cringe. It was in this way that I injured my hand when the chisel
slipped, giving me 13 stitches in my left hand from wrist to thumb, leaving two
of my fingers numb to virtually all feeling. I was very lucky that this was not
worse.

Despite the fact that this was modest cottonwood, this particular bowl has
surprising figure and curl.
