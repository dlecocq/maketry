title: Marker Holder
---
When I designed my daughter's
[craft desk]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-04-07-craft-desk %}), I added
three holes to accept cups for holding crayons, pencils, and things. I thought
that they would make a great way to accept different interchangeable modules as
well -- a marker module, a painting module, etc.

As one of her Christmas presents, I made this marker holder. I turned a chunk
of maple to fit perfectly into the recess, leaving a lip on it to that it
doesn't fall through the hole. Before turning the dome shape, I evenly spaced
holes to accept the markers. Then I could mount it on the lathe and turn the top
into a gentle dome before sanding, finishing.

__Update 2017-04-24__: While does _look_ nice, with so little clearance between
markers, it's difficult for an adult to use, let alone a child. The markers are
just too securely lodged in the caps.
