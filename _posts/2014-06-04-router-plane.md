I can't remember who originally inspired me to make one, but this is a classic
homemade tool project since it just requires a block of wood, an old hex key,
and an eye bolt.

I chose a hefty block of walnut, and once flattened, thicknessed, and squared
up, I marked a round hole in the center width-wise and towards the front. Since
I didn't have a forstner bit large enough, I cut it out on the scroll saw. While
here, I cut a hex shape out to seat the hex key I was going to use. With that
complete, I could run it through the table saw with the blade at an angle to
form the bevel on both sides and the front.

I marked out a pleasing arc and cut that out on the bandsaw and smoothed it with
a file. Then more file work to connect the bevels from the sides to the one on
front as smoothly as possible. I drilled out for the eyelet and chiseled out
a slot perpendicular to the hex key slot, into which the eyelet would fit when
full retracted.

I drilled some holes to receive a couple of knobs that I turned, and glued those
in place. A little more sanding, some finish, and the body of the plane is done.

I ground the hex key on the disk sander very carefully, cooling it regularly to
keep from ruining its temper.
