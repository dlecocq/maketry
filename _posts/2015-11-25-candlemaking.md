I'm always on the lookout for projects that will get my young daughter
interested and enchanted with making things. It was in service of this goal that
I got a candlemaking kit from [Peak Candles Supplies](http://www.peakcandle.com/).
Getting a starter kit was helpful in making a few candles, but I quickly made
a few changes and choices:

- __molds__ - I'm not sure why seamed molds are even made -- they leave a rather
  unsightly seam line along the side of the candle. In some situations they're
  necessary because of the geometry of the molded shape (you couldn't have a
  seamless sphere mold, for example), for pillars there are usually seamless
  alternatives.
- __dyes__ - the kit came with dye chips, which appear to have more a limited
  selection of colors, are more difficult to control the dosage of, and much
  less cost-effective. The liquid dyes are much better on every front.
- __wax__ - while paraffin is a fine wax, palm wax is much more interesting and
  beautiful for simple pillars. As palm wax candles cool, they form interesting
  shapes and textures on the surface.
- __double-boiler__ - rather than an improvised double-boiler, if you're going
  to make candles with any frequency, a presto pot for a double-boiler makes
  life far easier.
- __flattening__ - the conventional wisdom for flattening candles it to place it
  briefly on a hot surface. I've _never_ been able to get good results with this
  method. While there's every possibility that I'm doing it poorly, for me it
  either comes out not lop-sided and/or with a lip of wax from squeeze-out. The
  technique I use that is the _only_ way I've ever been able to get good results
  is more tedious, but looks much better. I clamp the cooled candle in the mold
  with just a little bit of the bottom extending. Then I use a box-cutter and
  the edge of the mold as a guide to cut it flat. The center should be very
  slightly cupped out so it sits flat.
- __wick pins__ - Rather than pour the wax with the wick tied to the bottom and
  through a centering mechanism, I much prefer a wick pin. It won't deflect as
  the wax cools, and will give a nice, clean wick. When the wax is poured with
  the wick in place, the colored wax will seep up the wick.
- __centering__ - For each new mold that I get, I make a board out of plywood
  the fits snugly around the rim of the mold with a hole to accept the wick pin
  that has been perfectly centered.

Here are some candles I recently made for gifts.
