title: Barbecue Bracket
---
Over every burner in a grill is a roof-shaped piece of metal to protect the
burner from grease and the like. On my grill, the brackets supporting them
broke recently.

They're riveted into the back of the grill, and are also responsible for holding
the end of the burner. Rather than get rid of the grill, I took some 16 gage
steel and made replacement brackets.

Two flaps on the top fold in at angles for the roof-shaped protector to rest on.
A flap on the bottom folds up to provide a surface for the burner to rest on.
After getting it folded up with a metal vise (I don't have a sheet metal brake),
I added a couple coats of high-temperature spray-paint and riveted them on the
grill.
