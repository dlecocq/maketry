title: Birthday Cake

I did a [practice cake]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-13-valentines-cake %})
last month in anticipation of my daughter's birthday. This cake went better than
last time (especially with no cakes overflowing).

This time I put the two colors of frosting in two separate bags, and then put
the two bags in the largest frosting bag. This worked really well to not let the
colors mix in the bag.

I also used a more open star-tip, which allowed me to make bigger and more
well-formed shapes, so the process went _substantially_ faster than last time.
