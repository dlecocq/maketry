title: Slim Leather Wallet
---
Until now, my existing slim wallet has been treating me fine. But its age is
showing and I'm beginning to have doubts about its structural integrity. So I
made this wallet.

It features two pockets and folds in half. After glueing up the pieces, I
trimmed all the sides to be perfectly flush. A grooving tool marked where the
seam would go, and diamond chisels made the holes for sewing. I marked it with
my branding iron and then finished it with resolene.
