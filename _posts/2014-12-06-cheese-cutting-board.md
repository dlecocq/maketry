I'd seen swivel-arm cheese slicers / cutting boards for sale somewhere and
figured that I could make some myself. This was a great opportunity to use up
some scraps to glue up a bunch of blanks.

The boards themselves are about 8-10" long, and 5-6" wide, if I recall. The
width is a function of the arm, but they can be long as you care to make them.
One the boards are glued, planed, and squared up, drill the hole to receive
the arm. Take care to make this reasonably straight.

After inserting the arm, you can estimate where to make the cut in the top to
accept the wire. It is better to err on the side of making it too far from the
edge, as excess can always be cut off, and the hole for the arm deepend.

I would recommend using a number of light coats of a spray finish if padauk is
involved as even if you clean the sawdust after sanding, the color is very
likely to leech into neighboring pieces of wood.
