title: Custom Tool Holders
---
Sick of hand tools littering every horizontal surface, I set out to make some
custom tool holders. A place for everything and everything in its place.

While it might seem a little obsessive, to have a clear spot for everything has
proved to be very pleasing. I put a plywood board on the wall after several
coats of shellac (to make it easier for dust to be brushed away) so that holders
could be mounted in any spot.

My favorite holder is one that holds the front and back of my jointer plane. The
bottom settles into a groove in the holder. The holders extend over the plane
such that the sides of plane so that it doesn't fall to either side. The top
portion has a groove deep enough to such that it can be lifted up and the bottom
of the plane slid out of the bottom of the holder.
