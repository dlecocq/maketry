title: Monthly Painting - Ant
---
I'm trying to get in the habit of doing a small, quick watercolor painting once
a month. The motivation is two-fold - 1) exercise some conventional creativity,
and 2) to get better at painting quickly. The purpose of capturing it here is
so that I might see any progress / development I make.

Whenever I've tried drawing or painting in the past, it's always been a slow,
meticulous process. I've come to believe that exercise only improves me in one
way -- it makes me better at making something in a glacially-slow meticulous
way. It also means that if and when I'm disappointed with the resulting work, it
means the lost of a substantial investment of time, so it tends to be a rather
make-it-or-break-it situation. It also means that I'm less willing to experiment
with techniques that might potentially ruin (or improve) the work.

Instead, the goal here is to paint something small over the duration of, say,
an episode of a TV show.

This month's contribution is an ant. Definitely informed by my recent struggles
with ants.
