title: Indexing Plate
---
Occasionally a project calls for making holes / marks in regular intervals
around a turned workpiece. For the markers on a clock, for instance. Or on a
bowl for aesthetic appeal. These cases call for an indexing plate.

While some lathes have an indexing system built in, other lathes have to make
do. [David Reed Smith](http://www.davidreedsmith.com/Articles/Indexing/indexing.htm)
came up with an idea to make a plate that has been turned round and then small
wedges cut out. It should be thin enough to fit on the threads _behind_ the
chuck, and the wedges deep enough for a locking pin to register in it.

I found this system to be very stable, and it's easy to make plates in any
necessary count.
