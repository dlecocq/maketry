title: Coat Hooks
---
A while back I added a second row of hooks in the entry way so that my daughter
could hang her coat, bags, etc. by herself. Increasing clutter has necessitated
an expansion on this front.

I bought 16 double-hooks from the local hardware store, and because I was in a
rush, some S4S maple from a local lumberyard. Had I not been in such a rush, I
would have definitely milled up some rough-sawn lumber myself!

I marked out holes to space them out evenly, and between them I added holes to
receive screws. We have plaster walls, and I've always found it very secure to
screw things directly to the wall, provided I can screw it into the lath.

Finally, I have space for my _own_ things.
