title: Monthly Painting - Tree, Turkey
---
This month I did a couple quick paintings. The first, a turkey, was partly
because I liked the idea of a painted hand-turkey because the shape has its
origin in a medium outside of paint. So to see it done in paint seems silly to
me.

The second I did has a layer first of light green covered with streaks of a
darker green. It was meant to be quick, but I wish I had gotten a more
consistent look from the dark green streaks. I came back after that was dry
with some acrylic paint for a string of lights.
