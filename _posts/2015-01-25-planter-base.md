title: Planter Base

Erin had a couple of potted plants that for ages lived on top of make-shift
bases. I glued up some scrap oak boards that I got from a pallet to make proper
ones.

I decided to turn one, which worked best. It was incredibly hard wood, and did
not much care to be turned.

The second one was square. I tried to hollow out the center with the router,
first using the router directly on it with an edge guide to ensure it was a
consistent distance from the edge. Hollowing out the extra waste, however, did
not go so well, and led to a very uneven surface.

One shaped, I poured a couple batches of epoxy on each, spreading it out and
painting it on with a cheap chip brush. A couple of non-slip nubs on the bottom
and they were functional, if more rustic than I had planned.
