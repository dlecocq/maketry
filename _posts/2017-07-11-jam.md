title: Jam

It's the jamming time of year. Every year I tell myself that I'm not going to
miss you-pick season, and this was the first year that I remembered in time.
Then I looked at the prices compared to the fruit stands and grocery stores and
found that it wasn't really worth my time. I still plan to go and pick wild
blackberries, but for farm-grown fruits, I'm happy to have them harvested for
me.

I had originally planned just to do strawberry jam, but when at the grocery
store, I saw that canning jars were half off and so I went a little bit nuts and
decided to buy about 4-6 lbs each of blueberries, cherries, raspberries. Some
were reserved for straight-up eating, but most found their way into jars.

Over the course of a couple afternoons, I made about 60 jars in all, which means
that my daughter should be stocked up for the rest of the year. That's even
after taking a dozen to work and some over to various neighbors.
