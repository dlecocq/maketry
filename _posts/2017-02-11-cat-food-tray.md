title: Cat Food Tray
---
To keep my cat's food and water dishes arranged and off the floor (the radiant
floor heat causes her water to evaporate rather quickly), I made this quick
tray from scrap wood.

Using a pencil, I traced the outline of the bases onto a piece of plywood, which
I then cut out and used with a template bit to route in the recess into an old
scrap board. A couple of dadoes on the bottom to accept the legs, some sanding,
a little finish, and there we have it.
