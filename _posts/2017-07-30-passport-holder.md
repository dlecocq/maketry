title: Passport Holder

I wasn't entirely pleased with [my last]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-02-10-passport-book %})
passport holder, so this was a second attempt. Specifically, the last one was
too stiff, the strap was an afterthought, and it didn't have as much space as
I'd hoped.

This one holds two in each side, and has two thin leather straps to secure the
thing. I also much prefer the look of the leather after it has been dyed with
this diluted mahogany dye.

In keeping with what has become my typical dyeing process, I first wetted the
leather before applying the dye diluted in rubbing alcohol. It always looks a
little splotchy (far less than dyeing it dry), but once a little neatsfoot oil
is applied and some finish, it looks pretty consistent to me.
