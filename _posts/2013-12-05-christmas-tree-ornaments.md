title: Christmas Tree Ornaments
---
In addition to snowflake ornaments, I had an idea to make Christmas tree
ornaments as well. The idea was to compose it out of several layers of
contrasting woods - one layer for below, a layer for the tree trunk, one for
each tier of branches, and then one for the top. I made a prototype to see if
it would work:

Judging the results to be close to but not quite what I wanted, I bought some
maple and walnut to make a larger version.

To help keep everything aligned, I made a shallow cut in the center of each end
of each layer with the bandsaw. I then used a section of old, broken bandsaw to
in that slot as I was gluing it up to ensure everything stayed aligned. It
worked reasonably well:

I mounted the block on the lathe and turned it to be a cylinder. Once done, I
carefully sliced off ornaments at the bandsaw and then used a disk sander to
smooth out each side. This would have gone significantly faster with a thickness
sander.
