After my daughter expressed some interest in making candles,  we made a few only
to realize that we had nothing to put them in! So I turned a couple of candle
holders and experimented with black stain.

I like the look of black-stained wood, but I found it difficult with this
particular one to get a consistent, streak-free finish.
