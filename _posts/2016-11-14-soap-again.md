title: Soap Again
---
After the
[previous attempt]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-09-15-soap %}) to make
soap led to less-than-pleasing results, I decided to try again with Kevin. This
time I used the wax-paper-lined wood molds that I made for the previous attempt,
and it worked pretty well.

I was attempting to make a three-toned soap reminiscent of space / a nebula. It
would be part black, part pinkish purple, and streaks of sparkle mica suspended
in glycerin. Upon mixing the soap, I separated the the mix into two, colored
each independently. I poured one, then the other on top, and tried to gently
swirl the two without mixing the colors to much. I then added the sparkle-mica
glycerin mix, though I should have added it at the same time as the soap, and
probably between the two layers -- because I'd already swirled them, I couldn't
afford to swirl much more without risking mixing the colors.

It didn't come out as well as I'd hoped (the mica is hardly visible), but I
suppose it could have gone worse.
