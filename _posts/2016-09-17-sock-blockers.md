title: Sock Blockers
---
The coworker who taught me to
[make socks]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-06-30-knit-socks %}) asked me to
maker her a sock-making accessory -- sock blockers.

After knitting a sock, it does not have that sock-like shape to it. The process
of wetting a sock, inserting a mold, and letting it dry is called 'blocking,'
apparently.

She gave me the pattern she wanted to use, and after cutting out a template in
some thin plywood, I then used that template to route out a couple of copies
with a pattern bit. A roundover on all edges, some sanding, and several coats of
polyurethane and there you have it -- sock blockers.
