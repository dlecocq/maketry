title: Melt and Pour Soap
---
A while back I had hoped to engage my daughter with making soap, but after
making a couple batches, it didn't seem like a good fit. Even aside from the
dealing with sodium hydroxide, there's the fact that it's kind of a long process
and requires swift action at some points of the process. But that still leaves
melt-and-pour soap.

My daughter helped me pick out a color and smells, and then we picked out some
small toys to get trapped inside the individual soaps. That leaves a fun
surprise for once enough soap has been used up.
