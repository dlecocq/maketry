title: Monthly Painting - Owl, Frisket
---
A little while back I remembered seeing someone on YouTube make a greeting card
with liquid frisket and watercolor. As I paint something for my daughter every
month, I thought it would be a good occasion to try the technique.

While I certainly could have gotten a smoother application of the background
colors, it went alright. While the pencil I used to sketch in some lines couldn't
be erased after watercolors, I have found that it can be erased from under the
frisket. I should have just sketched the writing in pencil. I suspect it would
take some practice to get good at writing with frisket.

My daughter's class has a pet stuffed animal, a snowy owl, that all the kids
adore. Inspired by the frisket, I thought it would be easy enough to mask out
and paint an owl:

While there are some things I would change about this, I have to admit that I'm
quite pleased with how it came out and I'll likely try making a larger picture
of a similar theme as a gift in the future.

I tried experimenting with a triangularization, but as the thickness of the
lines is not very consistent, and as the lines aren't perfectly straight, I'm
not particularly pleased with it. Still, perhaps it's an idea to explore later.

I had this idea of masking some shapes off and applying a wash, letting it dry
and masking off more shapes, and so on and so forth. I think the washes were a
little too dilute, but I liked the idea. Again, being unable to get consistent,
straight lines turned me off from this one.

I thought it might work well for constellations. I used toothpicks to try to get
the thin lines and small stars, but again the fact that the lines weren't
perfect bothers me. I'll have to explore solutions in the future.
