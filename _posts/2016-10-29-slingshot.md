title: Slingshot
---
A couple of months ago, Kevin and I took my daughter for a hike. On the hike, we
found that someone had left a couple of slingshots along the trail with a
challenge to hit a bell that had been left up in a nearby tree. I never played
with slingshots as a child, but even as an adult, it was quite a bit of fun.

As one of her christmas gifts, I made her a slingshot from maple with a rosewood
veneer accent running down its center. She helped me in the shop a little bit
to draw out its profile, see what dimensions would work best for her.

After cutting out the rough profile from the glued-up blank in two axes. After
cutting out the Y-shape, I taped the offcuts back on so I could set the piece
on its side to shape its profile. After that, it was lots of rasping, filing,
sanding, and eventually finishing with polyurethane.

I've yet to make a leather pocket to put a payload and add a rubber band, but
I'm excited about the prospect.
