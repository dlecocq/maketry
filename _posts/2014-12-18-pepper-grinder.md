I made a pair of pepper mills for gifts. These were my first pepper mills, but
it went alright. Per Brendan Stemp's
[recommendation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdPQ7sfZeeU), I got CrushGrind
mechanisms.

Rather than using the clips and the "CrushGrind tool," I removed the clips and
epoxied the mechanism in place.
