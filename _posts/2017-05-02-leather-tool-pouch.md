title: Leather Tool Pouch
---
Among the leather tools that
[Jonathan gave me]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-04-29-tiny-plane %}) were
some leather tooling stamps. Most had some light surface rust from an apparent
leak into the container in which they were stored, so they needed some cleaning.

I found Brasso to be relatively effective, but the knurling on the handles was
difficult to clean. The most effective thing I found to deal with that was a
brass wire wheel in a rotary tool; I would make one pass with the wheel aligned
with one direction of the knurling and a second pass in the other direction.

Once cleaned, I wanted a place to keep them all together, so I made this quick
little leather pouch to keep them in.

The corners are a bit too square, and the flap is wider than I would have liked.
If I were to do it all over again, I'd probably make the flap taper from the
fold to the snap, and sew the thing inside out.
